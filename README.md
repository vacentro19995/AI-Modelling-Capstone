# AI-Modelling-Capstone

This is a capstone project for my Master's Degree wherein I used a dataset available online via Kaggle.
The dataset contains health issues.
The aim of this capstone is to predict whether a person will survive or not based on the data gathered.

There are various processes made for this capstone project.
1. The dataset underwent data wrangling to clean the data and exploratory analysis as well to understand the relationships of the features.
2. Feature Selection was also implemented to find the optimal features that can help in predicting the output.
3. Three predictive models were used and ran using default parameters and optimal parameters having the features as all features and selected features. 
4. The models used were K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression.
5. Grid Search was the optimization used in order to find the best possible combination of parameters.
